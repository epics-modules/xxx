<h1 align="center">xxx Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 6-2-1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Adjustments for scaler code being broken out from std module</li>
</ul>
    
<h2 align="center">Release 6-2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Parts of common.iocsh that were likely to be changed moved out to settings.iocsh</li>
</ul>
    
<h2 align="center">Release 6-1</h2>
<ul>

<li>autsaveBuild files are now built in the autosave directory so that the primary iocxxx directory
doesn't need to be open to be written by anyone.

<li>xxx.adl screen updated to match tab-style design of the .ui file.

</ul>


<h2 align="center">Release 6-0</h2>
<ul>

<li>Added lua scripting module
<li>Added SoftGlueZynq module
<li>Added Yokogawa DAU module
<li>Added dxpSitoro module

<li>iocBoot/iocvxWorks, iocBoot/iocLinux, etc: Condensed into single iocxxx directory
<li>st.cmd.Linux, st.cmd.vxWorks, etc: Individual startup scripts provided for each architecture
<li>All startup scripts using iocsh to eliminate most architectural differences
<li>Startup scripts rewritten to use iocshLoad capabilities of base-3.15

<li>xxx.ui updated to take full advantage of caQtDm widgets

<li>xxxApp/src/Makefile greatly simplified

<li>release.pl modified to fix an issue where it wasn't checking optional includes

<li>softioc startup script now includes options to start medm and caQtDM
<li>MEDM and caQtDM startup scripts cleaned up

</ul>


<h2 align="center">Release 5-8-3</h2>
<ul>

<li>Changes to support caputRecorder
<li>Added GROUP env var for alive record

<li>release.pl modified so that module definitions are processed in the order
they occur.  This allows, for example, the following:
<pre>
include $(SUPPORT)/configure/RELEASE
CAPUTRECORDER=$(SUPPORT)/caputRecorder-1-4-2
</pre>

in which the CAPUTRECORDER definition overrides the definition in
$(SUPPORT)/configure/RELEASE

</ul>


<h2 align="center">Release 5-8</h2>
<ul>

<li>Deleted xxxCommonInclude.dbd since it is no longer used.

<li>Many changes for areaDetector-2-0

<li>Use the alive module

<li>Added xxx.sh, a script to start/stop/restart a linux ioc in a screen session.
Improved in-screen.sh and run scripts.

<li>Rewrote xxxApp/src/Makefile: .dbd users must come after sources, so required
stuff is defined before it is used, but .lib users must come before sources, so
required references are encountered before a library is searched.  Added ifdefs
for ETHERIP, ALIVE, DELAYGEN, and VAC modules.

<li>New configure/CONFIG from 3.14.12.4 makeBaseApp

<li>start_caQtDM: Added drag-and-drop workaround for caQtDM.

<li>iocBoot/iocvxWorks, iocLinux: Changed many .cmd files to use doAfterIocInit.
Added commented out examples of using autosaveBuild.  (AutosaveBuild requires
either base 3.15.1, or a patched copy of base 3.14.12.)

<li>iocBoot/iocvxWorks/softGlue.cmd: Example of registered interrupt service
routine.

<li>iocBoot/ioc*/calc.cmd: new file

<li>xxxApp/src/Makefile: changes to build with 3.15

<li>Many changes to use caputRecorder

</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-7-1</h2>
<ul>

<li>iocBoot/iocLinux: new filter.substitutions from optics, added
async_pid_slow.substitutions, scan1Menu.req

<li>iocBoot/iocvxWorks: new filter.substitutions from optics
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-7</h2>
<ul>
<li>string sequence records moved from std to calc module
<li>Added .ui files for caQtDM
<li>rewrote xxxApp/src/Makefile to build dbd file and specify link libraries
according to what modules are defined in configure/RELEASE
<li>SIS38xx setup changed for mca-7-3-1
<li>Added configMenu for softGlue and scans.
<li>Added support for async_pid_slow, new XIA filter software
<li>Deleted vxStats (replaced by devIocStats)

</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-6</h2>
<ul>
<li>Include areaDetector, dxp, modbus, softGlue
<li>configure/RELEASE changes
<li>CSS-BOY displays and .def files
<li>start_epics for bash, setup_epics improvements
<li>Added op/burt directory for interp, softGlue
<li>vxStats replaced by devIocStats
<li>Many changes to match new or modified features in external modules.
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-5</h2>
<ul>
<li> Added busy module, deleted ccd and pilatus modules
<li> Deleted iocxxxCygwinInclude.dbd, iocxxxWin32Include.dbd,
iocxxx_solarisInclude.dbd -- build the targets in Makefile instead.
<li> .dbd file changes to agree with synApps 5.5 module choices
<li> Additions for areaDetector
<li> added multilayer mono, FuncGen, softGlue to xxx.adl
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build modified to agree with 3.14.10 version of makeBaseApp.pl
<li>Use of genSub module replaced by use of aSub record from base 3.14.10.
<li>Use new busy module.
<li>iocSolaris: Added databases Io.db, ramp_tweak.db, pvHistory.db; must use 'var' to define variable
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-3</h2>
<ul>
<li>xxx/release.pl: Bug fix; "($macro) =" line was wrong.  Support "include"
entries without a macro.
<li>xxx/iocBoot/ioc*/*.substitutions: 3.14.9 will require macros in substitution
files to be enclosed in quotes.  Start now, since it's already legal.
<li>xxx/iocBoot/iocCygwin/saveData.req: added basename section
<li>xxx/iocBoot/ioc*: Some databases and autosave-request files in synApps
have been renamed so that the autosave-request file name can be autogenerated
easily from the database name, e.g.: <name>.db <--> <name>_settings.req.
This will permit utils/makeAutosaveFiles.py to work more comprehensively.
<li>xxx/iocBoot/ioc*/save_restore.cmd: Added modbus, pilatus, and vac to
requestfile path; Added call to save_restoreSet_UseStatusPVs()
<li>xxx/iocBoot/ioc*/st.cmd: scans.db was split into standardScans.db and
saveData.db, so it's easier to load multiple scan databases.
<li>xxx/iocBoot/ioc*/interp_settings.req: moved to calc module (and modified
there to agree with current interp database).
<li>unlisted changes in the build files to agree with changes in synApps. 
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-2</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>iocBoot/iocCygwin/* -- Added examples for loading databases,
specifying autosave PV's, and invoking SNL programs, for orientation matrix,
femto amplifier, and pf4dual slit.
<li><p>pseudoMotor.db, sumDiff2D.db, and coordTrans2D.db are now in the motor
module, and not in xxx.  This affects some substitution files in iocBoot/ioc*.
<li><p>Some synApps databases used to specify input/output message terminators,
and no longer do this.  Message terminators must be specified in serial.cmd.
<li><p>Added examples for userArrayCalcs, pvHistory, XIA slit, string sequence, timer
<li><p>Specified message terminators for Digitel in serial.cmd
<li><p>Added example of setting system clock rate to iocvxWorks/st.cmd
<li><p>Added new motor types to xxxApp/src/*
<li><P>Scaler database loading has changed to accommodate asyn-based device support.
<li>Modified substitutions files in iocBoot/ioc* to enclose in quotes any macro
substitutions that themselves contain macro arguments (i.e., X=$(Y) -> X="$(Y)").
This will be required in EPICS 3.14.9.
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-1</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixes to run from support directory on the gateway.
<li><p>MPF is out; asyn is in
<li><p>Don't need to specify handshake PV in saveData.req.  It's now
hardwired into saveData.
<li><p>Split out many .cmd files from st.cmd
<li><p>Multi-element mca setup now in device-specific files
<li><p>Serial/GPIB config now in asynRecord.template, serial.cmd
<li><p>serial_OI_Block, GPIB_OI_Block -> deviceCmdReply
<li><p><a href="cvsLog.txt">cvs log</a>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 5-0</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>start_epics_xxx - added new modules to EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH.  Added
specification of EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES
<li><p>documentation/vme_address.html - table of VME addresses, interrupt vectors, etc.
<li><p>iocxxx - split into iocUnix, iocvxWorks
<li><p>st.cmd, xxxApp/src - changed xxx.dbd to iocxxx.dbd, xxx_registerRecordDeviceDriver to
iocxxx_registerRecordDeviceDriver because c function name cannot begin with a number
<li><p>st1.cmd - cd to topbin/../vxWorks-68040, so we don't have to have a separate
cdCommands file.  Load xxx.munch instead of a bunch of separate files
<li><p>st1.cmd - must configure dac before ip330PID
<li><p>vxStats.substitutions - new file to work with vxStats module
<li><p>pid*.substitutions, dac128V.substitutions - new files
<li><p>xxx.adl - added vxStats, Keithley 2000; changes in mca, DAC
